# Fission Hub Backend

Fission is pioneering the future of AI in the Web3 era. By combining the power of decentralized technologies with cutting-edge AI, we are creating an inclusive, transparent, and community-driven ecosystem where AI models evolve and grow through collaborative efforts.

This repository is a monorepo that contains code and modules to interact with the Fission network. The tech stack is Typescript, and NestJS.

# Repository Scope

This repository publicly tracks the development of features being added to the Fission Hub. 
However, internal business logic remains private, meaning the actual execution of this code is not possible.
